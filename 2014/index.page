<p>The 2014 Open Help Conference &amp; Sprints took place June 14-18
in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Open Help brings together leaders in open
source documentation and support, as well as people from across the
technical communications industry who are interested in community-based
help.</p>

<p>The Open Help Conference features two days of presentations and open
discussions. In true open source spirit, our discussions and agenda are
led by our attendees, allowing you to learn and share what matters to
you most. With some of the most interesting people in the industry, the
Open Help Conference showcases the ideas that are shaping the future of
help.</p>

<p>Following the conference, multiple teams take part in the Open Help
Sprints, collaborative team meetings where people put ideas to work.
Donâ€™t have a team to bring to the sprint? Join us anyway and learn from
the people who are pioneering documentation sprints.</p>

<p>Open Help 2014 is over, but you can still have a look at the sessions
and speakers.</p>
