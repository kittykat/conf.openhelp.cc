<title>2014 Sessions</title>

<p>Want to show the world what you’ve been working on? Email your
proposal to <link href="mailto:conf@openhelp.cc">conf@openhelp.cc</link>.
We’re interested in any topic related to documentation, support, and
open communities. In particular, we’re excited to see talks related
to the following:</p>

<list style="compact">
  <item><p>Engaging user communities to create user-generated content,
  managing contributions and contributors, and getting people excited
  about helping other users.</p></item>
  <item><p>Running effective documentation sprints, either in-person
  or remotely.</p></item>
  <item><p>Making documentation available to everybody through better
  internationalization, localization, and accessibility.</p></item>
</list>

<p>The Open Help Conference has a heavy focus on open discussion,
so we prefer presentations that foster discussion and collaboration.
Plan to speak for 45 minutes. Proposals are evaluated as they come
in, so send your proposal as soon as possible.</p>

    </list>

    <p>Fostering and sustaining a community of volunteer writers
    is a big job. It’s not enough to simply capture their attention;
    you have to keep it, and you have to make it easy for them to
    find appropriate, useful tasks they can accomplish.</p>

    <p>During this talk, you’ll learn about the latest ways Mozilla
    is engaging with its community of writers, as well as the tools
    we’ve built (and continue to build) to make it easier for
    contributors to find things to do that are appropriate to their
    skills and availability.</p>

    </list>

    <p>While Laziness, Impatience and Hubris might be the virtues
    of a programmer, Diligence, Patience and Humility are the
    virtues of a great docs writer. Rich shares some insights
    gleaned from 15 years of working on documentation and answering
    the newbies.</p>

    </list>

    <p>After over a decade of building online communities around
    open source projects, Shaun got entangled in an effort to open
    a grocery co-op in his neighborhood. He’ll share his experiences
    in building communities in real life, how they differ from online
    communities, and how many principles of community-building are
    always the same.</p>

<section id="briefs">
  <title>Demos and Briefs</title>

  <p>Do you have something you want to show off, or something quick
  to say without preparing a full talk? We have slots for demos and
  brief talks. Briefs can be as short as a few minutes or as long
  as 15 minutes, but be prepared for questions. Email
  <link href="mailto:conf@openhelp.cc">conf@openhelp.cc</link> with
  a short description.</p>

  <section id="jana_svarova">
    <title>Rewriting Markdown Documents into Mallard: Check Lists</title>

    <list style="compact">
      <item><p>Jana Svarova</p></item>
    </list>

    <p>How to assist the reader to grasp not only the amount of
    information but also the order in which the information should
    be read and processed? How to provide the reader with logical
    and clear structure that would lead them linearly in the
    topic-based manner?</p>

    <p>On the example of rewriting checklists into Mallard, this
    brief talk demonstrates various uses of this markup language,
    which allows for writing even less usual document types. The
    talk focuses on the Mallard strengths in general as well as
    particular implementation details.</p>
