<media src="openhelp2012.png" style="floatstart" width="125" height="125"/>

<p>Once again, the Open Help Conference will bring together
leaders in open source documentation and support, as well
as people from across the technical communications industry
interested in community-based help.</p>

<p>The Open Help Conference features two days of presentations
and open discussions. In true open source spirit, our discussions
and agenda are led by our attendees, allowing you to learn and
share what matters to you most. With some of the most interesting
people in the industry, the Open Help Conference showcases the
ideas that are shaping the future of help.</p>

<p>Following the conference, multiple teams take part in the
Open Help Sprints, collaborative team meetings where people
put ideas to work. Donâ€™t have a team to bring to the sprint?
Join us anyway and learn from the people who are pioneering
documentation sprints.</p>

<p>Open Help 2012 is over, but you can still have a look at
the sessions and speakers.</p>
