<title>2015 Sessions</title>

<p>Want to show the world what you’ve been working on? Email your
proposal to <link href="mailto:conf@openhelp.cc">conf@openhelp.cc</link>.
We’re interested in any topic related to documentation, support, and
open communities. In particular, we’re excited to see talks related
to the following:</p>

<list style="compact">
  <item><p>Engaging user communities to create user-generated content,
  managing contributions and contributors, and getting people excited
  about helping other users.</p></item>
  <item><p>Running effective documentation sprints, either in-person
  or remotely.</p></item>
  <item><p>Making documentation available to everybody through better
  internationalization, localization, and accessibility.</p></item>
</list>

<p>The Open Help Conference has a heavy focus on open discussion,
so we prefer presentations that foster discussion and collaboration.
Plan to speak for 45 minutes. Proposals are evaluated as they come
in, so send your proposal as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Open Help does not have the budget to cover the travel expenses of
speakers, but we are happy to provide free registration to speakers.</p>

    <title>Drop the angled brackets. Write (Ascii)Docs with pleasure!</title>

    <list style="compact">
      <item><p><link xref="speakers#jason_porter"/></p></item>
    </list>

    <p>Writing documentation is already hard enough. Why do we make it
    more difficult by burying the content in an XML syntax like DocBook
    or wrestling with finicky WSYWIG editors?</p>

    <p>What if you could just write? Forget about the layout and styling
    and just let the thoughts flow? That's the idea behind the lightweight
    markup languages such as AsciiDoc. With AsciiDoc, the bulk of document
    is the content, embellished with subtle and intuitive semantic notations.
    AsciiDoc is designed for humans, yet machine parsable. It can even meet
    the most advanced publishing requirements.</p>

    <p>Come learn how to write documentation with pleasure using AsciiDoc
    and still be able to produce beautiful HTML, DocBook and PDF
    documents--and even presentation slides! Like this one.</p>

  <section id="janet_swisher">
    <title>Ten years of MDN as a wiki community: mistakes, lessons, and successes</title>

    <list style="compact">
      <item><p><link xref="speakers#janet_swisher"/></p></item>
    </list>

    <p><link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</link>
    (MDN) just celebrated ten years as an open documentation wiki and an open
    documentation community. In this session, I'll look at MDN as a
    <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system">sociotechnical</link>
    system, that is, how its technological and social facets affect one another.
    I'll talk about things we've done wrong and what we learned from them, as well
    as things we've done right and how we know. (Spoiler: the content of this session
    will largely overlap with this blog post,
    <link href="https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2015/07/23/ten-years-of-evolution-of-mdn/">Ten
    years of evolution of MDN</link>, but will focus more on the development of
    the community.)</p>

  <section id="shaun_mccance">
    <title>Ducktype: An extensible lightweight syntax for Mallard</title>

    <list style="compact">
      <item><p><link xref="speakers#shaun_mccance"/></p></item>
    </list>

    <p><link href="http://projectmallard.org/">Mallard</link> is a uniquely dynamic
    and extensible format for topic-oriented help. Its dynamic linking system allows
    new pages to be dropped into existing documents without patching, and its
    extension mechanisms let you add new features or mix in vocabularies like TTML,
    SVG, and MathML. Mallard relies heavily on the extensibility of XML, and although
    XML provides excellent tooling, it's not popular as a writing format.</p>

    <p>Ducktype is a new lightweight format designed explicitly to handle everything
    that Mallard can do. It can be used for everything from simple pages to pages
    with embedded SVG, all without angle brackets. Most importantly, it can express
    all of the metadata needed to make Mallard's automatic navigation work. Learn
    about the challenges of making a non-XML format that can do everything XML can.</p>

  <section id="warren_block">
    <title>Doc Fail</title>

    <list style="compact">
      <item><p><link xref="speakers#warren_block"/></p></item>
    </list>

    <p>In this talk, we'll look at all the ways the documentation keeps repeating
    the same mistakes. By recognizing these, we can help to avoid repeating them.</p>

<section id="briefs">
  <title>Demos and Briefs</title>

  <p>Do you have something you want to show off, or something quick
  to say without preparing a full talk? We have slots for demos and
  brief talks. Briefs can be as short as a few minutes or as long
  as 15 minutes, but be prepared for questions. Email
  <link href="mailto:conf@openhelp.cc">conf@openhelp.cc</link> with
  a short description.</p>
